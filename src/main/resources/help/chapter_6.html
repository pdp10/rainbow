<P>It shows processes to whom the resource is attributed.</P>
<P><A NAME="Deadlock"></A><BR><B>Deadlock</B>: 
</P>
<P>A set of processes is in a deadlock state if every process waits
an event that only another process in the same set can throw. There
are four conditions to rise a deadlock: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mutual exclusion: every resource
	can be accessed by only a process. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hold and wait: processes, that
	obtain resources, can ask other ones. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No preemption: A resource assigned
	to a process cannot be subtracted to it until the voluntary release
	of the process. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Circular waiting: there is a circular chains of requests
	among processes to resources. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P><BR><B>Multiplicity</B>: 
</P>
<P>It is the maximum number of processes that a resource can be
attributed in the same time. A resource with multiplicity 1 and no
preemptive, is said to be accessed in mutual exclusion way.</P>
<P><A NAME="ap"></A><BR><B>Assignment policy</B>: 
</P>
<P>An assignment policy sorts the queue of blocked processes. It
determines how blocked processes wake up when the resource waited
becomes available.</P>
<P><A NAME="sp"></A><BR><B>Scheduling policy</B>: 
</P>
<P>A scheduling policy sorts the ready queue. It determines how ready
processes are dispatched to the CPU.</P>
<P><A NAME="processes"></A><BR><B>Process</B>: 
</P>
<P>A process is a program in execution. Inside an operating system, a
process control block (PCB) manages current values of program counter
registers and other variables. A PCB is an entry of the process
table, which is manages by the scheduler. In this application
processes are abstraction of real ones.</P>
<P><A NAME="resources"></A><BR><B>Resource</B>: 
</P>
<P>A resource is everything can be accessed and used. P.E. a file, a
device, a function etc. A resource can be preemptive or not
preemptive.</P>
<P><BR><B>No preemptive resource</B>: 
</P>
<P>It is a resource that cannot be subtracted to a process that is
using it.</P>
<P><BR><B>Preemptive resource</B>: 
</P>
<P>It is a resource that can be subtracted to a process that is using
it.</P>
<P><A NAME="simulation"></A><BR><B>Simulation</B>: 
</P>
<P>It is the temporal evolution of the process management.</P>
<P><A NAME="Batch"></A><BR><B>Batch system</B>: 
</P>
<P>A batch system is characterized by a determined sorting, no
preemptive, long execution jobs. This approach reduces context switch
among processes, improving performances.</P>
<P><A NAME="Interactive"></A><BR><B>Interactive system</B>: 
</P>
<P>An interactive system is characterized by a great variety of
activities. Preemption is needed.</P>
<P><A NAME="RealTime"></A><BR><B>Real time system</B>: 
</P>
<P>A real time system is characterized by short execution processes,
often with deadline.</P>
<P><A NAME="state"></A><BR><B>State of a process</B>: 
</P>
<P>The states of a process are: to activate, ready, running, blocked,
terminated.</P>
<P><A NAME="waitingTime"></A><BR><B>Waiting time</B>: 
</P>
<P>It is the time when the process is waiting for execution.</P>
<P><A NAME="responseTime"></A><BR><B>Response time</B>: 
</P>
<P>It is the time perceived by the end user is the interval between
the instant at which an operator at a terminal enters a request for a
response from a computer and the instant at which the first character
of the response is received at a terminal.</P>
<P><A NAME="TurnaroundTime"></A><BR><B>Turnaround time</B>: 
</P>
<P>It is the time between the placement of an order and its delivery.</P>
<P><A NAME="Throughput"></A><BR><B>Throughput</B>: 
</P>
<P>It is the number of job per hour that the system is able to
complete.</P>
<P><A NAME="Time slice"></A><BR><B>Time slice</B>: 
</P>
<P>The period of time for which a process is allowed to run in a
preemptive multitasking system is generally called the &quot;time
slice&quot;. The scheduler is run once every time slice to choose the
next process to run. If the time slice is too short then the
scheduler will consume too much processing time but if it is too long
then processes may not be able to respond to external events quickly
enough.</P>

policies</i></H3>
<P>In this paragraph, all available scheduling policies are
described: 
</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="FIFO"></A><B>FIFO</B>:
	(First In First Out) This is a policy for batch system. It holds the
	ready queue sorted by FIFO. So the first process added to the queue
	is the first to be extracted by the dispatcher. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="SJF"></A><B>SJF</B>:
	(Shortest Job First) This is a policy for batch system. It holds the
	ready queue sorted by execution time increasing. So it will extract
	always the process with minimum execution time. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="SRTF"></A><B>SRTF</B>:
	(Shortest Remain Time First) This is a policy for batch system. It
	is a variant of SJF policy because it apply the preemption of the
	running process when a process with a minor execution time is
	inserted in the queue. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="RoundRobin"></A><B>Round
	Robin</B>: This is a policy for interactive system. It holds the
	ready queue sorted by FIFO, but executes the running process per a
	quantum of time. When the quantum expires, the running process is
	put to the tail of the queue. The quantum is also called time slice.
		</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="PriorityRoundRobin"></A><B>Round
	Robin with Priority</B>: This is a policy for interactive system. It
	is a variant of the classic round robin policy. On details, it holds
	the ready queue sorted by priority decreasing. So it will extract
	always the process with the highest priority. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="PreemptiveOnPriorityRoundRobin"></A>
	<B>Preemptive on Priority Round Robin</B>: This is a policy for
	interactive system. It is a variant of the round robin with priority
	policy. On details, it applies the preemption of the running process
	when a process with higher priority is inserted in the queue. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="HPF"></A><B>HPF</B>:
	(Highest Priority First) This is a policy for interactive system. It
	holds the ready queue sorted by priority decreasing. So it will
	extract always the process with the highest priority. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="PreemptiveHPF"></A><B>Preemptive
	HPF</B>: (Preemptive Highest Priority First) This is a policy for
	interactive system. It is a variant of the HPF policy. It applies
	the preemption of the running process when a process with higher
	priority is inserted in the queue. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="HRRN"></A><B>HRRN</B>:
	(Highest Response Ratio Next) This is a policy for interactive
	system. The response ratio of a process is so defined:
	response_ratio = (expected_execution_time + waiting_time) /
	expected_execution_time . It will extract always the process with
	the highest response ratio. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="MF"></A><B>MF</B>:
	(Multilevel Feedback) This is a policy for interactive system. The
	ready queue is made of several queues sorted by FIFO policy. An
	activated process is inserted on the tail of the queue Q0. As Round
	Robin, it executes the running process, which was before ready in
	the queue Qi, only for a quantum of time. Then the process is
	inserted in a queue Q(i+1). It always extracts, if exists, the
	process in the queue of lower level. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="PreemptiveMF"></A><B>Preemptive
	MF</B>: (Preemptive Multilevel Feedback) This is a policy for
	interactive system. It is a variant of the classic Multilevel
	Feedback policy. It applies the preemption of the running process
	when a new process is inserted in a queue of lower level than the
	level of the queue of the running process. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="MFDQ"></A><B>MFDQ</B>:
	(Multilevel Feedback with Dynamic Quantum) This is a policy for
	interactive system. It is a variant of the classic Multilevel
	Feedback policy. The quantum value depends on the level of the
	queue. On details: 
	</P>
	<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">queue of level 0 :
		dynamic_time_slice = time_slice 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">queue of level i-th:
		dynamic_time_slice(i) = 2 * dynamic_time_slice(i-1) 
		</P>
	</UL>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So a process executes for a quantum of
	time as longer as the level of queue is higher. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="PreemptiveMFDQ"></A><B>Preemptive
	MFDQ</B>: (Preemptive Multilevel Feedback with Dynamic Quantum) This
	is a policy for interactive system. This is a variant of the
	Multilevel Feedback with Dynamic Quantum policy. It applies the
	preemption of the running process when a new process is inserted in
	a queue of lower level than the level of the queue of the running
	process. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Linux"></A><B>Linux</B>:
	This is a policy for interactive system. It is the Linux scheduling
	policy. See <A HREF="#par_5">references</A> for details. (Not supported yet!)
	</P>
	<LI><P><A NAME="UNIX"></A><B>UNIX</B>: This is a policy for
	interactive system. It is the UNIX scheduling policy. See <A HREF="#par_5">references</A>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="par_3"></A><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; 6.3. Assignment
policies</i></H3>
<P>In this paragraph, all available assignment policies are
described: 
</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="FIFOAssign"></A><B>First In
	First Out:</B> This policy holds the queue of requests of processes
	to a resource sorted by FIFO. So the first process blocked in the
	queue is the first signaled in the queue when the non-preemptive
	resource will become available. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="HPFAssign"></A><B>Highest
	Priority First:</B> This policy holds the queue of requests of
	processes to a resource sorted by HPF. So the first process signaled
	when the non-preemptive resource will become available is the
	process with the highest dynamic priority in the queue. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><A NAME="RandomAssign"></A><B>Random:</B> This policy holds the
	queue of requests of processes to a resource sorted by FIFO.
	However, the process signaled when the non-preemptive resource will
	become available is chosen in a random way. This policy simulates
	the behavior of the notify() method in Java. (By assuming in this
	context, processes instead of threads)
